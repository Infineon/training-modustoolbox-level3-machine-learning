# ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level3 Machine Learning

This is a class to teach how to use the ModusToolbox™ Machine Learning solution. The descriptions and exercises use a PSoC™ 6 MCU along with motion sensors and microphones to develop IoT applications for gesture detection, keyword detection, etc.

After completing this class, you should be able to create and debug machine learning applications using ModusToolbox™. Several Infineon machine learning partners are also discussed.

The ModusToolbox™ Machine Learning Technology Pack must be installed to complete the exercises in this class.
